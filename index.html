      <p>I'm a PhD student at CMU's Heinz College Of Information Systems and Public Policy. I'm interested in how machine learning can better serve the public interest.</p>
      <p>My specific research interest has two components:</p>
      <p>(1) Holistic evaluations of ML systems: designing better assessments of the fairness and privacy dimensions of the types of ML models already being deployed in high-stakes domains.</p>
      <p>(2) New methods for causal inference: further incorporating ML into the traditional econometric toolkit for program evaluation.</p>
      <p>
My interest in these areas stems from a long-held fascination in the mathematical models we build of the social phenomena around us. Over the course of my academic and professional career—first as an economics researcher and more recently as an ML engineer—I’ve seen how helpful models can be both for explaining the world and for automating otherwise resource-intensive tasks. But I’ve also seen their limitations–in particular how added complexity can obfuscate human understanding and how the inevitable gaps that open up between the model and the real world result in real costs for the people affected by these models. As more and more human decisionmaking is ceded to models, it becomes ever more important to measure and ameliorate their shortcomings.
